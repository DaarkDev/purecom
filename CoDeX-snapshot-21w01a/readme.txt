FileLink v1.3.4a ~ Linux Distro

It is important to note that the code of many commands
have been altered to only operate on linux, which is now
the primary target system of FileLink (previously PureCom).
Older versions will still be available on github and possibly
other sources in the future, but will not be updated as
frequently and may not have the same features as the linux
distribution has now.

Note: Inside of the 'src' directory, there is a 'uicolor.txt' file.
This is used for the user input color, and it is not recommended to
tamper or modify the file unless you understand the source code that
is related to it. Also, the 'run.sh' shell script can be used to
quickly execute the primary lua file, and requires for lua5.1 to
be installed on your linux system.
