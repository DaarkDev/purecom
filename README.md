## Description
*****
The purpose of this console application is to provide a user friendly experience of something that potentially feels
somewhat similar to MS-DOS. I plan to maintain this project for as long as possible, as long as either I have the
motivation to do so, or at least the community wants me to keep committing and adding new features as well as continue
to develop this piece of software. There are a number of uses for this type of program, and I hope that you can find
the one or more ways that best suit you and provide what you would like. My goal for this program is for it to still
be a console application, but to continue to grow and provide users with a light-weight friendly and fast experience
on both ends. This project for now will be mainly scripted entirely in [Lua](https://www.lua.org), but as time goes
on it is possible that me or other contributors will somehow make use of other languages in this software. If you
are interested in becoming a contributor, you can join the discord (Information at the bottom of this page) and DM
or talk to me. Please note that I'm mainly looking for people who already have prior experience, or at least somewhat
know what they are doing and can contribute well in some way. If the instructions are not clear or you have suggestions,
feel free to keep me posted by joining our discord server and talking to me. Please do not try to hide the source of
my program for any reason, even if it is a modified distribution that is not the original, as I want everyone to be
able to learn and view the source of this project.
