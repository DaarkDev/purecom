# CoDeX

CoDeX (pronounced "co-deck") is a distribution that sources primarily from the original
purecom repository code, but has been modified and tweaked to run on linux with more
features, linux compatibility, and bug fixes. The "co" part of the name refers to the term
"co-op", meaning that is stems from and works with the original purecom. The second half of
the name, "deck", means that it is a deck of new features and changes, or metaphorically
"a different deck of cards". 

CoDeX has currently been tested on the Raspberry Pi 4 operating system for a while now,
and as far as I can tell it is basically fully compatible. I will try to be focusing
more on this version of filelink (previously purecom) because it can run faster
since it runs on linux. As far as I know, it should also be compatible with most
other linux based operating systems as long as you have lua5.1 installed and
some other feature-dependencies that should come pre-installed on all if not most
linux distributions.

Hopefully soon I should be able to test it's compatibility with Ubuntu, but I don't
know for sure when. If anyone is interested in reporting bugs, you can email me [here](https://rentry.co/ny5k9)
