# FileLink

This project is a huge work in progess, so the old documentation/readme file
can be found [here](https://ghostbin.co/paste/wwqdm).

Currently, FileLink is the new formal name of this project but is subject
to change especially if a better name suggestion is submitted. Although,
we do plan to primarily use a code name once we think of a good one.

We are trying to sort of "revamp" this project by making different
distributions to fit the environment you are running. However, the
exception to this is macOS because we do not plan to support it because
I'm sorry but if you code on any apple product you are (most likely)
a soydev willing to buy any garbage product they produce. Our new
primary target platform will be the family of Linux operating
systems, but we should also have a distribution specifically
for windows at some point.
